=================================


This package contains a documented style file for easily typesetting
requirements documents in LaTeX.


Installation
------------

The package is already pre-compiled. However, in the case where it is
needed for recompiling, a Makefile has been provided. The users
can simply issue the following command:

  make

This will perform the following:
- To create the style file "reqdoc.sty"
- To create the documentation "reqdoc.pdf"
- To create the sample "sample-normal.pdf"
- To create the sample "sample-compact.pdf"

The style file "reqdoc.sty" should be copied to some proper location
for LaTeX to find it later (e.g.,
"/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/reqdoc.sty").
