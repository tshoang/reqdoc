Macros for Requirements Documents
=================================


This package contains a documented style file for easily typesetting
requirements documents in LaTeX.


Installation
------------

To install the package, first unpack it in some location then issue the
following command:

  latex reqdoc.ins

This will produce a new file named "reqdoc.sty" that you should copy to
some proper location for LaTeX to find it later (e.g.,
"/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/reqdoc.sty").


Documentation
-------------

There are two documentation files delivered with this package:

  - File "reqdoc.pdf" contains the source of the style file in the
    classical literate programming style.

  - File "refcard.pdf" contains a list of the package macros typeset
    on one page for easy reference.
